			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Guest!</h1>
			<p>
				This is my first attempt at creating a landing site.  I am completely new to any kind of computer programming, html or anything of the like.
                                 And i honestly have no idea what this really is or how to accomplish much on it.
				But if you are reading this I must have figured something out.  
				Until my understanding and/or skills improve a bit, the most I will be trying to do here is perhaps to share some varous text
				and that may be about all I can figure our for the time being. 
				This is based off of modifications to the to the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
				template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
				a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.
			</p>
			<p>
				This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
				React, or Vue to your project.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to <a href="https://docs.astro.build/"
